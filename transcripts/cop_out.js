          [Kevin continues] We had toured a show called "Hands Up", which was a 90-minute show, telling the stories of
          African-Americans and their experience with police profiling.

          [Shepsu Aakhu, Dramaturg, Writer, "Cop Out"] We wanted to give an opportunity to sort of try to balance that
          equation so that we can create dialogue. So what does it look like for police officers?

          [Shepsu] Let's read everything, let's figure out what we have. Let's figure out if what we have works. Then
          let's figure out why it works and then let's figure out how we can make it better... If you look at the idea
          of the play, what you're really looking at is passions. And with those passions they're invested in a point of
          view. Who am I, how do I see the world? And most of us are terribly resistant to the notion that there's more
          than one way to look at something.

          [Kevin] The thing that's really struck me is the general public's reaction to the work that we're doing. A lot

          [Shepsu] So my job is to figure out how to put together all these different writers and arrange them in a way
          that gives us a window into the lives of these officers in a way that allows us to lower our barriers enough
          just to hear them, so that we can get this work done.

          [Kevin] As an African-American, for me telling stories of police officers is a personal venture for me. I want

          [Shepsu] Communication is everything. The moment we're not communicating is the moment that things escalate
          and danger continues... As, literally, as a Black person, that is the last thing I want to happen. What I
          really hope for is that there's engagement. That the people that are listening actually care enough to lean in
          and then that we can make a commitment to keep talking.
